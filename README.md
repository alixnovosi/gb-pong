hello!!! this is my attempt to write Pong
in GB asm as a first project.

tools (incomplete?):
* neovim
* [rgbds - assembler and toolchain](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds)
* [binjgb - dev environment/debugger](https://github.com/binji/binjgb)
* [vim syntax highlighting for rgbasm](https://github.com/vim-scripts/rgbasm.vim) - line endings fixed [in my
    fork](https://github.com/alixnovosi/rgbasm.vim)

resources (Definitely incomplete):
* [pan docs](http://bgb.bircd.org/pandocs.htm#gameboytechnicaldata)
* [game boy programming manual](https://ia801906.us.archive.org/19/items/GameBoyProgManVer1.1/GameBoyProgManVer1.1.pdf)

you'll want to set syntax to rgbasm for .asm files,
perhaps using the .lvimrc file in the repo.
if so,
install [vim-localvimrc](https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc) with your plugin manager of choice.

Helped out a lot by https://github.com/eevee/anise-cheezball-rising and by 
https://github.com/hylyh/gameboy-helicopter starting out.
